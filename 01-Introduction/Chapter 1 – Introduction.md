# 01 - Introduction

## What is a Computer Network?
A collection of interconnected devices that share data, resources, and services.

**Examples**: Internet, office LAN, Bluetooth network.

## Types of Networks
| Type | Coverage Area | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| LAN  | Small area (office, home) | Office Ethernet |
| MAN  | City or large campus | Cable TV network |
| WAN  | Large geographical area | Internet |
| PAN  | Very small area | Bluetooth |

## Switching Techniques
- **Circuit Switching**: Dedicated path for entire session (Telephone system)
- **Packet Switching**: Data split into packets; each can take different route (Internet)
- **Message Switching**: Entire message sent, stored at intermediate nodes, then forwarded

## Network Models
### OSI Model
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

### TCP/IP Model
1. Network Interface
2. Internet
3. Transport
4. Application

**OSI → reference model, TCP/IP → implementation model**

## Types of Transmission
- **Unicast** – one-to-one
- **Broadcast** – one-to-all
- **Multicast** – one-to-many (group)
- **Anycast** – one-to-nearest

## Cybersecurity Context
- Networking knowledge is core for identifying and preventing attacks.
- Example: TCP SYN flood affects **Transport Layer**; ARP spoofing affects **Data Link Layer**.
