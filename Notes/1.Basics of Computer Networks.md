# 1. Basics of Computer Networks

## ðŸ“Œ Definition

A **computer network** is a group of interconnected devices that communicate with each other to share resources and information.
It enables communication between devices over wired or wireless media.

Example:
When your laptop connects to Wi-Fi to browse a website or to watch youtube videos, itâ€™s using a network to communicate with the web server.

Key idea:
**Networks are everywhere** â€” your home Wi-Fi, mobile internet, the LAN at your school/college/universities, and even cloud data centers.

## ðŸ“Œ Benefits of Networking

- **Resource Sharing**: Printers, files, and applications can be shared.
- **Communication**: Email, messaging, VoIP, video conferencing.
- **Centralized Management**: Simplified updates, security control.
- **Scalability**: Easy to add devices.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Redundant paths improve reliability.

## ðŸ“Œ Network Components

- **Computers**: Workstations, servers, laptops, mobile devices.
- **Servers**: Provide services like file storage, web hosting.
- **Routers**: Connect networks and route packets.
- **Switches**: Connect devices within a network.
- **NICs**: Network Interface Cards for connectivity.
- **Cables**: Twisted pair, coaxial, fiber optic.

## ðŸ“Œ Types of Transmission

- **Unicast**: One sender to one receiver.
- **Broadcast**: One sender to all devices in a network.
- **Multicast**: One sender to a specific group of devices.
- **Anycast**: One sender to the nearest receiver in a group.
- **Geocast**: Transmission to devices in a specific geographic location.

## ðŸ“Œ Switching Techniques

- **Circuit Switching**: Dedicated communication path (e.g., telephone network).
- **Packet Switching**: Data split into packets and sent independently (e.g., Internet).
- **Message Switching**: Entire message sent to intermediate storage before forwarding.
- **Cell Switching (ATM)**: Fixed-size cells used for high-speed networks.

## ðŸ“Œ Network Services

- **Connection-Oriented Services**: Reliable data delivery (TCP).
- **Connectionless Services**: Low overhead, no guaranteed delivery (UDP).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Transmission Modes

- **Simplex**: Data flows in one direction only.
- **Half-Duplex**: Data flows in both directions but not simultaneously.
- **Full-Duplex**: Data flows in both directions simultaneously.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Network Metrics

- **Bandwidth**: Maximum data transfer rate of a network.
- **Throughput**: Actual data transfer rate achieved.
- **Latency**: Delay between sending and receiving data.
- **Jitter**: Variation in packet delay over time.
